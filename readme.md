# This is a small app I made that generates random numbers.

## To install
```
git clone https://github.com/Ben-893/Random-Numbers-App
```
## To Use
```

* Right click on the index file, and then Open with Google Chrome, or whatever browser you're using

* The user will be greeted with a prompt window asking for a number. Enter a number and press 'ok'. 

* A  second prompt will appear and ask the user to type in a larger number than the precious one. Do that, and press 'ok'

* The app will pick a random number between the 2 inputs, and display that number on the webpage.

* If the user enters anything other than a number, or doesn't enter anything at all, they will get an alert telling them that they did not enter a vlaid number and must refresh the page and try again.
